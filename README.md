# Benchmark Guidelines

- Identical enviornment in terms of Compute, Network and Storage for all Java frameworks including:
  - Cloud environment (AWS Resources)
  - Java Runtime ([OpenJDK 11](https://github.com/openjdk)) & Heap Configuration
  - The application business logic will remain same across all the frameworks.
  - The application flow will remain the same across all the frameworks (as shown below) with induced latency of 100ms:

 sequenceDiagram
    HTTP Client->>+REST Controller (API): REST endpoint
    REST Controller (API)-->+Service: mimics business logic (latency 100ms)
    Service-->>-REST Controller (API): service reponse (POJO to json)
    REST Controller (API)-->>-HTTP Client: JSON response
 ```


# Benchmark & Monitoring Tools
- [Grafana K6](https://k6.io/open-source/) - for load testing
- [Grafana Cloud](https://grafana.com/products/cloud/) - for monitoring CPU & Memory Usage
- [Opentelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) - to instrument, generate, collect, and export telemetry data (metrics, logs, and traces)

Other options considered:
- [ApacheBench](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/programs/ab.html)
- [Hey] (https://github.com/rakyll/hey)
